                <hr>
                <p>Up to 60 players compete in matches with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_royale_game">battle royale</a>-style gameplay.

                Players, represented as jellybean-like figures, move around a three-dimensional playing field, with additional moves such as jumping, grabbing, or diving to assist gameplay. The aim is to qualify for subsequent rounds by successfully completing each of the randomly selected mini-games. Certain mini-games involve running towards a finish line at the end of the map, while others add elements of teamwork. 
                    <sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fall_Guys#cite_note-IGN:_Review-3">[3]</a></sup>
                On every mini-game, obstacles appear around the map for added complexity. Players who are too slow or who fail certain requirements for a mini-game are eliminated. On the final round, the remaining few players compete in a final match with a randomised mini-game designed for a smaller player size. The winner of the match is the last player standing.</p>
                <p>Using an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-game_currency">in-game currency</a>, "Kudos", players can purchase cosmetics and emotes for their character to show off in-game. Players obtain Kudos by completing matches and get "Crowns" (the premium currency) by winning. Some of the costumes are of characters from different games, such as Gordon Freeman from the <i>Half-Life</i> series or Jacket from <i>Hotline Miami</i>. The game supports <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microtransaction">microtransactions</a> for the purchase of additional in-game currency.</p>

                <h2>Development and release</h2>

                <p>
                    The conception of <i>Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout</i> began when Mediatonic was discussing another project in January 2018. One member, lead designer Joe Walsh, made a throwaway comment that it reminded him of game shows such as <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Takeshi%27s_Castle">Takeshi's Castle</a></i> and <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_Wipeout">Total Wipeout</a></i>. He drew from that inspiration to create a pitch document for what would become 
                    <i>Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout</i>. 
                        <sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fall_Guys#cite_note-washingtonpost-fallguysideas-1">[1]</a></sup> 
                    Originally titled <i>Fools' Gauntlet</i>, Walsh's pitch featured 100 players competing in a battle royale composed of physical challenges. Creative director Jeff Tanton, while initially skeptical that creating another battle royale game would be successful, was quickly convinced of the game's potential, and forwarded Walsh's pitch to Mediatonic's founders.
                </p>    
                <p>
                    Tanton and Walsh then began working on a pitch deck for the game. For the pitch deck, principal concept artist Dan Hoang created images featuring colorful, bean-shaped characters racing on an obstacle course in the sky. Tanton explained that Hoang's character designs helped shift the focus of the game away from the obstacle course itself, to the characters. With the pitch deck completed, Tanton pitched the game to 10 different publishers at the 2018 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_Developers_Conference">Game Developers Conference</a>. After Devolver Digital agreed to publish the game, development began six months later.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <i>Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout</i> began its initial prototyping process with a small team, growing to 30 people during development. Initial progress on individual minigames was slow which caused the team to worry that there wouldn't be enough content for launch. A turning point came when the team came up with a group of pillars that "Took the opinions of people out of the occasion" and allowed the developers to "kill ideas faster". Such pillars include making sure a minigame was "50-50 chaos and skill" and that a level had to be "different every time". In an attempt to remain faithful to the game shows they were inspired by, as well as differentiate from first-person shooter battle royale games, Mediatonic's focus was on gameplay variety. By presenting the player with several, randomized rounds of game modes, Mediatonic hoped to recreate the experience of being on a game show. To help keep the "spirit of playground games and game shows", Mediatonic created an internal rule that game modes needed to be explained in three words. Over time, the game underwent numerous other changes. The player count was decreased from 100 to 60, as the games "stopped being readable or fun" when there were too many players competing. To the latter point Mediatonic noted that when testing the game players would overestimate the number of players in a given level stating "we didn’t need as many players as we thought to create the crowds we wanted the gameplay to include."
                </p>
                <p>
                    <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/It%27s_a_Knockout">It's a Knockout</a></i>, a game show that forced its contestants to dress up in oversized costumes, inspired the idea that the characters should "have that element of being completely uniquely, badly designed for the task that we were gonna put them through". The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ragdoll_physics">ragdoll physics</a> were implemented on purpose, because Mediatonic did not want them to be like "hyper athletic <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sasuke_(TV_series)">Ninja Warrior</a></i> characters" and because "falling over is funny". According to Walsh, striking the right balance between funny ragdoll collisions and game performance was critical, because "as soon as you lose the ragdoll-ness of the character, you lose the comedy". The character designs were inspired by the look of vinyl toys.

                    <i>Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout</i> was announced at E3 in June 2019 and was released on 4 August 2020 for Microsoft Windows and PlayStation 4. Prior to release, it was announced that <i>Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout</i> would be free for PlayStation Plus members during the rest of August.
                </p>
                <p>
                    On 12 August 2020, Mediatonic had announced their first major update would be arriving on the next day, as well as announcing that additional content would be added in the future. Later that month Mediatonic revealed a trailer for the medieval themed second season at Gamescom.

                <p>
                    On September 2020, Lead Level Designer Megan Ralph described the game's popularity as surprising, saying that "[the developers] didn't really expect people to be sitting down playing this game for seven hours a day, but they are."

                    Tom Wiggins of Stuff magazine praised the game, calling it "<i>Super Monkey Ball</i> for the <i>Fortnite</i> generation". Mercury News praised the "controlled chaos" gameplay of Fall Guys, stating it to be utilizing a combination of the elements from the battle royale game Fortnite and the party game Mario Party in such a way that made it "tailored to the coronavirus age".
