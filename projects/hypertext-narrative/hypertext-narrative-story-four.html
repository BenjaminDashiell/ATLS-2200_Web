            The Coronavirus pandemic has wreaked havoc throughout the country.
            Unfortunately, the pandemic has taken a toll on your mental health.
            The company you were working for had to cut costs and you were one of many employees that were laid off.
            Once your savings run out, you won’t be able to cover rent and the landlord has every intent to collect.
            You had to cancel your summer trip, which you were really looking forward to.

            Currently, you’re laying down in your bedroom.
            You haven’t bothered to get out of bed for several weeks, aside from answering the door for take out delivery.
            You haven’t been able to meet in person with your friends and they haven’t been answering your messages or calls.
            You’re just wasting away your days, lazily scrolling through the internet.
