            This past month has been mentally draining for you.
        </p>
        <p class="entry">
            During the summer, you received some unfortunate news. 
            Your grandma passed away peacefully in her sleep. 
            Grandma was the GOAT. 
            She practically helped raise you while your parents had to work. 
            She always knew how to make you smile. 
            She passed on many of her life lessons to you and is the reason you are who you are today.
            She was your rock. 
            But now, the family is gonna feel more empty.
            She’ll never get the chance to see you finally find your significant other.
            She’ll never get to see you raise a family.
            She’ll never get to see you change the world like she always knew you would.
            And you’ll never get to taste grandma’s cooking ever again.
            Even with the recipes, it’ll never be the same again.
        </p>

            Without her around, how could you continue? Do you <b>give up</b>?
