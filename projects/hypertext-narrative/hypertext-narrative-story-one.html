            Congratulations, you are halfway through the semester. 
            Unfortunately, you are currently failing your Physics class. 
            You’ve been turning in every homework assignment and only to receive scores of 60% or lower.
            You take notes during lectures, but the information and concepts clearly aren’t sinking in.
            At your current rate, you are projected to fail this class. 
            You need to pass this class in order to graduate and it is a required course. 
            Your only hope to start turning this around is to score well on the midterm, but you only have a week to efficiently catch up on 2 months worth of material.
            There’s no way you could do it.
        </p>
        <p class="entry">
            Perhaps you should give up. Will you?
        </p>
