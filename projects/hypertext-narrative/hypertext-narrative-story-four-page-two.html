            Your mental health has reached its breaking point.
            Your phone drops to the floor and all you can do is burst into tears.
            As you cry, the back of your mind tells you that we canâ€™t take more of this.
            Everything you have done throughout your life is now meaningless.
            There is no future anymore.
            All you know what to do right now is to cry and succumb to the depression.
