            Now you lie crying in your room, eating a lot of ice cream. 
            All the memories from the past year you shared together are ruined. 
            Tainted by the truth. 
            Any happiness you once had is now gone. 
            The only thing left is this feeling of hollowness. 
            You’ll die alone now. 
            No one could ever fill the void left in your heart.
        </p>

            Perhaps it’s better to just fade away.
            Do you give up?
        </p>
