            You made no preparations during the week.
            You didnâ€™t bother to work with the professor or TAs to see why you were scoring really low.
            You ended up taking the exam and performed about as well as turning in an empty answer sheet.
            You never graduate and now this failure will haunt you for the rest of your life.
