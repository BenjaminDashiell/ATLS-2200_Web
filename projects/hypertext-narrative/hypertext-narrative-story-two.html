            Today was a heartbreaking day for you. Figuratively of course.
            You’ve been dating your significant other for over a year now. 
            Things were going great for the two of you. 
            Until today. 
            You receive a call from a close friend. 
            You assumed nothing was wrong and answer. 
            They delivered some shocking news to you. 
            Your significant other was been secretly cheating on you and your friend explains while on a stroll, he saw your significant other on a date with another person.

            You’re unable to process what your friend told you. 
            I mean, it couldn’t be true right. 
            There’s no way they would cheat. 
            Right … Right? 
            After some time, you contact your significant other to confront them. 
            Eventually, your significant other has to come clean and admit, yes they have been cheating on you. 
            After that, you call it off with them and break up. 
            It’s over between you two.
