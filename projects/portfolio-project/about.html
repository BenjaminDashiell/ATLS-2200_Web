                                Hello! My name is Benjamin Dashiell. 
                                I am a junior at the University of Colorado Boulder, majoring in Computer Science (Engineering) and a minor in the Creative, Technology, Design program (CTD).
                                I work as a video editor for Leed’s School of Business. 
                            </p>
                            <p class="aboutmeparagraphs">
                                Outside of the college and work, I spend my free time working on creative projects.
                                I primarily focus on video editing, but I occasionally do photography and side coding projects.
                                I currently edit and manage two YouTube channels, DragonLordLeda (my personal channel) and Just More Gamers (a collaborative gaming channel).
                                I can’t explain why but I’ve always had the drive to create.                                
                            </p>
                            <h1 class="aboutmeheaders">Why the name, DragonLordLeda?</h1>
                            <p class="aboutmeparagraphs">It all started when I hatched from an egg as a dragon. Okay, I’m joking.</p>
                            <p class="aboutmeparagraphs">
                                The story behind the name is back when I played Clash of Clans, 
                                I wanted to change my player name to something more fitting.
                                I’ve always liked dragons as a kid and one of the player names I wrote down was DragonLordL10A.
                                The L10A was an abbreviation of an old username (that's a whole other explanation).
                                I don’t know why 14 year old thought having it in my player names was cool.
                                Anyway, I showed my friend these player names to see what he thought was good.
                                My handwriting was SO BAD that he misread the L10A as “Lida” and pronounced it as Lee-da.
                                We laughed about how dumb that was but eventually, it stuck with me.
                                Since then, DragonLordLeda has went from my player name to becoming my creative persona.
                            </p>
                            <p class="aboutmeparagraphs">Also no, I don’t play Clash of Clans anymore :/</p>
